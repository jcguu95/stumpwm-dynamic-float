* 2.1.0 => 2.2.0

Change every appearance of =stumpwm-dfg-II= into =stumpwm-dfg=.

* 2.0.1 => 2.1.0

+ Support customizable new window behavior (see
  =*new-window-spec-hooks*= and related new functions.)

* 2.0.0 => 2.0.1

+ Fix the definitions of macros that help define commands. The
  original code smells bad (especially the =eval= in the macros),
  and produce different behaviors because =(ql:quickload ..)= only
  loads the file once the compiled files are present.

+ Fix bug: =#'get-xwin-with-xwin-id=.

+ Fix bug: Redefine the method =#'group-add-window= to reflect the
  official change (b6529119559231c9b60e4c7052946afb2cb454a7) in
  the official StumpWM repo.
